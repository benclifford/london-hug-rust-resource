0. Rust can provide memory safety by statically tracking who owns
each piece of allocated memory.  This needs more elaborate type
signatures, and plenty of wrestling to make it all compile -
something any Haskeller will be familiar with.  I'll talk a bit
about the theory, a bit about the concrete language features
that make this more usable, and a bit about some vaguely related
Haskell.

1. I'm going to talk about resource management in a language called
Rust, which I expect a lot of people have heard about, even if
they haven't used it.

I'm going to mix up three languages in the code examples:
Haskell (because, of course), C (because it has different
examples from Haskell), and of course Rust.

Briefly, Rust is a "safe, concurrent, practical language". What I think
is interesting is that they care about safety, but have a strong
emphasis on performance and are trying to be a competitor in the
same space as C.

The most notable use is that 
parts of the Firefox web browser are written in Rust.

It's got plenty of modern language features - here's a list - but
this isn't a Rust intro talk so I'm not really going to talk about them
except when needed.

2. resource management techniques - a review

First I'll briefly review some resource management techniques -
by resource I'm using memory as my main example, but there are
other examples such as open files; by "management", i mean
keeping track of how that resource is allocated, used and released.

2.1 There's an explicit, C-like, style.

(see slide)
We allocate some memory (for example, with malloc). We use it
(I don't care how, for the purposes of this talk).
We free it. Here I'm using r to mean a "reference" or a "pointer"
without getting too technical about what one of those is.

Or we open a file, write to it, and close it - the reference there
is the file handle.

In these two examples, that happens all in a row in the source code,
so it's quite easy to reason about.

In reality it is likely a reference gets passed around
stored and used in several different places,
on its eventual journey to being released.

(As a side note, C is pretty liberal about what you can
use that memory for - you can allocate a number of bytes without
really telling the compiler what you're going to use those bytes
for.)

The correctness proof happens "in our head (or test suites etc)",
not in the compiler.

2.2 Another style of resource management is to use garbage collection.

This has been round since the 1950s, though I first really used this in
Java. It's pretty much the standard approach for memory
management in high level
languages - for example, it is how Haskell does things - but not other
stuff like file handle management.

So how does this work?
We allocate some memory. We use it. We just stop talking about it
and it goes away. Eventually.

An advantage here is that if 'r' is in scope,
we know the memory will not have been released.

We can't name a thing, unless that thing is valid: knowing the "name"
of the thing keeps it valid.

A disadvantage is that garbage collectors run at runtime - this adds on
a bunch of runtime overhead. Namecheck pusher/will for their
especially degenerate garbage collection situation they encountered.

Another disadvantage is that sometimes we do want to be a
bit more explicit about when 
a resource is released - we want to know a file has been closed,
perhaps - but with garbage collection, you have to "hope" that you
really have got rid of all references and that the collector runs
"in time".

By "hope" I mean manually prove outside of the type system.

  mutate(&x)
}
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
A third way is scope based, local variables: built into C, and
provided by bracketing style of helper function for files in 
Haskell.

The resource is released when the scope ends: in the C example,
the space usually happens to be on the stack and disappears when
we return from the function; in the Haskell example, we have this
helper which opens a file, passes the handle, and then closes
the file at the end - so the handle is valid within this
scope defined by the lambda expression.

  return &x;
}
</code></pre>



<aside class="notes">
We don't write a free call, and x will always be released, but we
need to be careful to not pass a reference to x outside of the
scope (for example, if mutate stores it in a global struct for
later use) - otherwise we get "use-after-free" bugs like in the
earlier examples.

<aside class="notes">
3. So let's dig down to some of the basic things you can do with
references/handles/pointers, and how those things can cause trouble
with reasoning. These are things you can do to any value in most
languages, but the problems specifically arise when those values
are references, that is names to some other resource (a pointer to
member, a file handle).

First, we're allowed to forget references. We might just stop
talking about a variable; or we might only pattern match 
part of a tuple.

When we do this, we hope that someone else (either another part
of our code, or a garbage collector) will release the resources.

</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
That's usually combined with being able to duplicate references. We've
passed a reference into <code>mutate</code> or <code>putStrLn</code>
and those have done some stuff and then forgetten the reference,
but that's fine, because we've also kept a copy for ourselves to
use to free/close later.

Those two everyday operations - forgetting and duplicating - are part
of what makes it quite hard to reason about whats going on.

Controlling these inherently dangerous operations
is a big part of Rust's resource management story.

<section>
<pre>
Every value in rust is owned by exactly one variable. When that
variable goes out of scope, that value is freed.

To begin with, that looks like the scope based model I talked about
previously.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(&r);
}

Rust puts in a static implicit free when r goes out of scope.
To be clear - it isn't garbage collected.

It's basically doing this, which is more explicit and also valid rust.

[slide]
fn main()
{ 
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(&r);
  drop(r);
}

OK, so here's some buggy code. It's got a use-after-free bug that
I hope is obvious - we've release r and then attempted to use it.

Rust rejects this! There error says on line 6 we tried to use a value,
but something had happened at line 5.

It looks like it is detecting that r has been released, and giving
an error - but that error talks about "moving" which is a more
general concept.

What has happened here is that I've transferred ownership of that
vector - instead of being owned by <code>r</code> in this current
scope, it has been handed over to be owned by drop, and so we can't
also have it owned by r any more. So we have this novelty that
variables can disappear effectively
out of scope by using them in certain ways.

Then it turns out that the implementation of drop just releases
all the resources and can safely forget about te value.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(&r);
  drop(r);
  process(&r);
}

5 |   drop(r);
  |        - value moved here
6 |   process(&r);
  |            ^ value used here after move


===

So why does that happen for drop and not for process? Because we're
passing in a reference to that value, rather than passing the
value itself.

References have slightly different rules applied to them, but there
is still novel checking going on.

Here's more code, with two function calls - it'll output the
vector size twice.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(&r);
  process(&r);
}

fn process(s : &Vec<i32>) {
  println!("vector size: {}", (*s).len());
}

$ ./a 
vector size: 3
vector size: 3

===

What happens if I try to release the vector inside the process
function - trying to introduce a different use-after-free
bug.

As we might hope, we get a compiler error - "cannot move out of
borrowed context". What does that mean? When we call drop, we
transfer ownership of the value to drop. But, inside "process"
we don't actually own s, so it isn't ours to give away.

We've just "borrowed" it from the caller, and part of that calling
contract is that at the end, we have to give it back.
We can't release it;
we can't transfer the ownership to someone else.

We can however allow another function call to borrow it from us, deeper
and deeper: we know statically 
that next level of function will give it back,
because it's only borrowing, and so we know that at the end of
process, we'll be able to give it back.


[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(&r);
  process(&r);
}

fn process(s : &Vec<i32>) {
  println!("vector size: {}", s.len());
  drop(*s)
}

error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
  --> a.rs:10:8
   |
10 |   drop(*s)
   |        ^^ cannot move out of borrowed content



====

To clarify that, here's a different implementation that
fails. Instead of "process" borrowing the vector, it takes
ownership of it (which includes responsibility for dropping it).
So now the vector is allocated in main, but ownership is moved
to process, and release at the end of process. We can see statically
that it isn't available to be passed into the second call of process.
If we wanted to, we could return it back as a return value though.

A lot of rust developers talk about "fighting the borrow checker".
This is basically making what I've just shown you work in real world
situations. To me, it feels quite like when you have complex type
signatures in haskell that you're trying to get to type check
and you can sort of see how but it is still a battle.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  process(r);
  process(r);
}

fn process(s : Vec<i32>) {
  println!("vector size: {}", s.len());
} // release happens here

error[E0382]: use of moved value: `r`
 --> a.rs:5:11
  |
4 |   process(r);
  |           - value moved here
5 |   process(r);
  |           ^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `r` has type `std::vec::Vec<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

Now, look at this bit of the error message, where it says a move
occurs because the vector type doesn't implement the copy trait.
Traits are like haskell typeclasses, and the copy trait is a marker
that says actually you can safely duplicate this value. If it's a
simple type, such as a 32 bit integer, then the ownership rules
can be more relaxed.

===

so here's the same code, but instead of using a vector, it uses
a single integer. This compiles and run fine because i32 has
the copy trait. So all this borrow checking and ownership
stuff doesn't apply to "simple" values, thankfully. Just to more
complicated values.


[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = 10;
  process(r);
  process(r);
}

fn process(s : i32) {
  println!("integer is: {}", s);
}

$ ./b 
integer is: 10
integer is: 10

====

Now let's talk about reference lifetimes a bit. here's some code
that given two vectors, returns the longest of the two. I'm passing
in two references, that are each
borrowed from somewhere, and returning one of those references based
on a length test.

This doesn't compile. We've been given two references to vectors,
and we know
those references are valid inside the function because we've borrowed
those values - so we can do things like look at the lengths.

But if we return a reference from a function, how do we know how
long that reference is for? What if I want to return a reference
to a value that goes out of scope at the end of the calling function?

In this code, the l reference is going to be valid as long
as r and q are both alive; but if either of them has been dropped,
then potentially there's a problem and we can't be allowed to
use that reference any more.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let q = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
  let l = longest(&q, &r);
  process(l);
}

fn longest(s : &Vec<i32>, t : &Vec<i32>) -> &Vec<i32> {
  if (*s).len() > (*t).len() {
    return s;
  } else {
    return t;
  }
}

error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> c.rs:9:45
  |
9 | fn longest(s : &Vec<i32>, t : &Vec<i32>) -> &Vec<i32> {
  |                                             ^ expected lifetime parameter
  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `s` or `t`

====

we can get round this by using lifetime annotations, like this. These
are compile time variables that refer to reference lifetimes.
What we've said is that longest wants to be given some lifetime
a (at compile time), such that 
s and t are references that both valid for at least that long;
and the reference that comes back will also be valid for at least
that long.

In this example, in main, we call longest with an implicit compile
time parameter that refers basically to the scope of main: r and q
are valid in that scope, and so the return value l is valid in that
scope too.

If we called longest somewhere else, there might be a different
implicit scope for that invocation.

[slide]
fn main()
{
  let r = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let q = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
  let l = longest(&q, &r);
  process(&l);
}

fn longest <'a> (s : &'a Vec<i32>, t : &'a Vec<i32>) -> &'a Vec<i32> {
  if (*s).len() > (*t).len() {
    return s;
  } else {
    return t;
  }
}

===

So finally, I'd like to talk about smart pointers. These are pointers
or references that know when they are dropped, so they can do some
of your own processing - a bit like a finaliser in garbage collection,
but safer and more useful.

A basic example of this is the rust reference counted smart pointer.
This allows data to be owned simultanously by multiple variables,
and keeps a value allocated as long as any one of those owners still
exists; it moves away from compile time reference checking, and
goes back to something a bit more like garbage collected runtime
checking.

We can make a vector value and make a reference counted smart pointer
to it - then we can clone it - and use r and q as if we owned the
value. We can drop one, but the other stays alive. The final drop
is what will actually drop the vector.

[slide]
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main()
{
  let r = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
  let q = r.clone();
  process(&r);
  process(&q);
  drop(r);
  process(&q);
  drop(q);
}

fn process(s : &Vec<i32>) {
  println!("vector size: {}", (*s).len());
}
====

A more interesting example, I think, is a mutex,
which gives a taste of some of rust's concurrency libraries.
We can lock the value protected by the mutex and simultaneously
acquire a smart pointer to that value - the lock remains until
that smart pointer goes out of scope.

[slide]
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main()
{ 
  let r = Mutex::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
  { 
    let r1 = &r.lock().unwrap();
    process(r1);
  }
  { let r2 = &r.lock().unwrap();
    process(r2);
  }
}


===
And very finally, what does Haskell offer in this space?

There's a linear types proposal, including an implementation that
I've run on my laptop to check it was real.

This isn't aimed at exactly the same target as rust, and has a
very different feel, 
but it has a
lot of similarities in so much as it cares
about how and how many times you reference a value,
so that more interesting behaviour can be built on that knowledge.

There's a paper you can read. Some of the things they claim to do
are on this slide and are quite different to rust.
